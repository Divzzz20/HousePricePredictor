I made this project centered around the development of a real estate price prediction website. The project unfolded in a structured manner, beginning with the construction of a predictive model using sklearn and linear regression techniques, employing the Banglore home prices dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. Subsequently, I embarked on the creation of a Python Flask server to operationalize the trained model, facilitating HTTP requests seamlessly. As the project evolved, I transitioned to the frontend development phase, designing and implementing the website interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This interface empowered users to input property specifics such as square footage and bedrooms, with the website seamlessly interacting with the Flask server to retrieve and display predicted prices. Throughout this endeavor, I navigated through various data science concepts, encompassing data cleaning, outlier detection, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, employing techniques like GridSearchCV and k-fold cross-validation. This project also provided valuable hands-on experience with a diverse array of tools and technologies, including Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Flask.
